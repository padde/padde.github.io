Turbo Tutorium was a project at Bauhaus-Universit√§t Weimar where students organized tutorials
to fill the gap between theoretical and practical work. Anyone could submit their ideas and
start their own tutorials, but the project quickly became too complex to handle manually.
A site to overcome this was built using Ruby on Rails, allowing potential speakers to
submit their tutorials, and users to vote on the events they would like to hear. The site
also featured an RSS feed for accepted tutorials, providing a way for users to keep up to
date with the latest developments.
