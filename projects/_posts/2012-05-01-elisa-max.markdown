Elisa & Max is a website for a wedding. The couple needed a way to easily
manage their wishlist, allowing visitors to click a link to mark wishes
as fulfilled. Another key feature of the application is the RSVP system:
invitations were sent out with a four-letter code that allows guests to reply
with the list of people that would attend the wedding ceremony. A password
protected admin interface then allows the wedding couple to access an overview
of all confirmed invitations. After the wedding ceremony, a thank-you card
was sent out to each guest, including a code to access the photos
taken during the festivities.
