Remote IP is a tiny web service that simply returns the IP of the remote client.
It is useful for finding out what your public facing IP is. I created this project
as a replacement for the automation page of [whatismyip.com](http://whatismyip.com),
which was unfortunately taken offline a while ago. A publicly hosted version is
available at [ip.paddd.de](http://ip.paddd.de). The project is a bare
[Rack application](http://rack.github.io) written in Ruby. Its source code is also
hosted in a [public repository on Github](http://github.com/padde/remote-ip).

Here is an example how this could be used from a shell script:
