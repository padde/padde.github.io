The Bauhaus Katalog ([katalog.bau-ha.us](http://katalog.bau-ha.us)) was an
online catalogue for the works of our fellow Bauhaus students. It aimed to
provide an easy way to publish works along with their metadata, for example
the medium, format, publishing date and so on. This allowed visitors to see
who collaborated with whom, what types of media they used and what related
projects there were.

Unfortunately, the site had to be taken offline due to copyright problems.
However, here is a screenshot of the project home page:
