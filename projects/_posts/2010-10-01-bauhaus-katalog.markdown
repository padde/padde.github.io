The Bauhaus Katalog ([katalog.bau-ha.us](http://katalog.bau-ha.us)) was an
online catalogue for the works of our fellow Bauhaus students. It aimed to
provided an easy way to publish works along with related metadata. This
for example allowed visitors to see who collaborates with whom, what types
of media they used and what related projects there were.

Unfortunately the site had to be taken offline due to copyright problems.
However, here is a screenshot of the project:
