Shrl, which is short for "short url", is a simple URL shortener I have written.
The problem with commercial services such as [bit.ly](http://bit.ly) is that you
never know how long they will be around; suddenly, your shortened links might all
be pointing nowhere! So I decided to roll my own as a fun project. I have hosted
mine at [shrl.paddd.de](http://shrl.paddd.de), but you can easily grab the source
code [from Github](http://github.com/padde/shrl) and have your own private URL
shortener.
