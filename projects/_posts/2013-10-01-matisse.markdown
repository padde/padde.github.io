Matisse is a Ruby Gem that I created. It is named after the famous french painter
[Henri Matisse](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Matisse), who is known for his colorful
works. It is meant as a replacement for the IRB output highlighter that ships with
[Wirble](http://rubygems.org/gems/wirble) since that did not fully meet my expectations.
Matisse is available as a Ruby Gem and can be installed with `gem install matisse`. The
code is open source and [can be found on Github](http://github.com/padde/matisse).

Consider the following IRB session with Wirble's highlighting enabled. It has problems with
highlighting exclusive ranges (those with three dots), and does not colorize all objects so
these are not always easy to spot.

Matisse, on the other hand, has a default highlighting and is easily extensible and customisable.
It renders standard objects like those pesky ranges correctly and highlights all objects so
these can easily be spotted when skimming through your session.
