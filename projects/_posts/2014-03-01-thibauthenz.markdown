Website for Weimar-based photographer Thibaut Henz ([www.thibauthenz.com](http://www.thibauthenz.com)).
The page was made using Ruby on Rails, which allowed for a very simple admin interface
that is custom-tailored for Thibaut's needs. For example, he can now choose a different
foreground and background color for every series himself. That way, the page adapts to the
content. In addition to building the site, hosting on Heroku and Amazon S3 was configured.
