The Vollkorn font family was always one of my favourites, but the bold face always felt a little too brutal to me. This was the number one reason I never actually used it in one of my projects, although I like the overall look very much. Luckily, [Friedrich von Althausen released version 3 of the Vollkorn family today](http://vollkorn-typeface.com/), including brand new Medium and Semibold weights. I am really looking forward to using these very soon!
