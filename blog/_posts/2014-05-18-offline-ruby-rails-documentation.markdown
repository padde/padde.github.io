title:  "Offline Ruby/Rails Documentation"
---

Undoubtedly, we software developers spend a good portion of our time reading
documentation, often online. Recently, I have been traveling a lot and although I
have my mobile phone set up for tethering, the internet connection is very fragile
at times. Waiting for pages to load forever is not really fun, so I needed a way to
access the most important Ruby and Rails documentation offline. Since there are
quite a few steps involved in setting this up, I thought I'd share it and hope
it will be useful for others as well.

Please be aware that this guide is written for OS X users; if you use a different
operating system, you will need to adjust the steps accordingly.

### Pow

Pow lets you start a local server that serves apps under a local url like 
`http://app-name.dev`. This makes it convenient to access the documentation we
will set up below and frees you from need to keep servers running on
localhost with meaningless port numbers that noone can remember. You can install
it via

{% highlight sh %}
curl get.pow.cx | sh
{% endhighlight %}

For more information, visit [pow.cx](http://pow.cx). I recommend using Pow
in conjunction with the [`powder` gem](https://github.com/rodreegez/powder),
which provides a convenience wrapper around the bare shell commands that are
used to manage up Pow apps. The most important command we will use is
`powder link [APP_NAME]`, which sets up your app to be served locally by Pow. You can
install `powder` from Rubygems via

{% highlight sh %}
gem install powder
{% endhighlight %}

### Ruby Core Documentation

Pre-rendered Ruby core documentation is
[available from ruby-doc.org](http://www.ruby-doc.org/downloads/).
To serve it locally via Pow, you can do:

{% highlight bash %}
mkdir ruby-doc-dev
cd ruby-doc-dev
curl -O http://www.ruby-doc.org/downloads/ruby_2_1_1_core_rdocs.tgz
tar xvf ruby_2_1_1_core_rdocs.tgz
mv ruby_2_1_1_core public
powder link ruby-doc
{% endhighlight %}

Your Ruby documentation is now available at [http://ruby-doc.dev](http://ruby-doc.dev).
Of course, adjust the version number to your needs and/or download multiple versions.

### Gem Documentation

{% highlight sh %}
gem install yard
{% endhighlight %}

Save the following file as `~/Library/LaunchAgents/YardDocs.plist` and adjust
the path to the `yard` executable as needed.

{% highlight xml %}
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
  <key>KeepAlive</key>
  <true/>
  <key>Label</key>
  <string>YardDocs</string>
  <key>ProgramArguments</key>
  <array>
    <string>/usr/local/opt/rbenv/shims/yard</string>
      <string>server</string>
      <string>--gems</string>
  </array>
  <key>RunAtLoad</key>
  <true/>
</dict>
</plist>
{% endhighlight %}

Next, start the server and set up Pow to do the port forwarding.

{% highlight sh %}
launchctl load -w ~/Library/LaunchAgents/YardDocs.plist
echo '8808' > ~/.pow/gem-doc
{% endhighlight %}

Your Ruby documentation is now available at [http://gem-doc.dev](http://gem-doc.dev).
If you are missing some gems in the list or have disabled documentation generation to
speed up Bundler as I did, you can regenerate all Gem documentations with the following
command:

{% highlight sh %}
gem rdoc --all
{% endhighlight %}


### Rails API Documentation

Rails documentation can be generated directly from a Rails app, so the first step is to
make a minimal Rails app that will serve the only purpose of displaying documentation.

{% highlight sh %}
mkdir rails-api-dev
{% endhighlight %}

First, add the `rails` gem in the desired version to your `Gemfile`. You will also need the
`sdoc`, `redcarpet` and `nokogiri` gems to generate the documentation, so go ahead and add
these as well.

{% highlight ruby %}
# Gemfile

source 'https://rubygems.org'

gem 'rails', '4.1.1'

gem 'sdoc'
gem 'redcarpet'
gem 'nokogiri'
{% endhighlight %}

Then, install all the Gems with

{% highlight sh %}
bundle install
{% endhighlight %}

Rails expects an application to be present before it lets you run the Rake task to generate
the documentation. You can fake an entire Rails application directly in the `Rakefile` like this:

{% highlight ruby %}
# Rakefile

require 'rails/all'
Bundler.require

module FakeApp
  class Application < Rails::Application; end
end

Rails.application.load_tasks
{% endhighlight %}

Now, you have Railsâ€™ Rake tasks at your disposal and are able to generate the documentation:

{% highlight sh %}
rake doc:rails
{% endhighlight %}

To serve the documentation with Pow, you need to add a Rackup file at `config.ru`

{% highlight ruby %}
# config.ru

require 'rack'

use Rack::Static, urls: ['/'], root: 'doc/api', index: 'index.html'
run ->{}
{% endhighlight %}

and finally you can serve it via Pow:

{% highlight sh %}
powder link rails-api
{% endhighlight %}

### Rails Guides

To read the Rails Guides locally, you can simply clone the folder that you have created for
the Rails API Documentation. 

{% highlight sh %}
cd ..
cp -R rails-api-dev rails-guides-dev
cd rails-guides-dev
{% endhighlight %}

This time, you need to run a different Rake task to generate the guides:

{% highlight sh %}
rake doc:guides
{% endhighlight %}

Since the guides end up in a different directory than the API documentation, you will need to
adjust the location specified in the Rackup file as well:

{% highlight ruby %}
# config.ru

require 'rack'

use Rack::Static, urls: ['/'], root: 'doc/guides', index: 'index.html'
run ->{}
{% endhighlight %}

Finally, you can set up Pow to serve the Rails Guides:

{% highlight sh %}
rm .powder
powder link rails-guides
{% endhighlight %}
